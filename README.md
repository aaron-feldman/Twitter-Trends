Developing a geographic visualization of Twitter data for keywords with associated "sentiment" (ie. positive or negative feelings)

This project was completed as coursework for the CS 61A course at the University of California, Berkeley. 

The project is programmed in Python 3.

It demonstrates to ability to use dictionaries, lists, and data abstraction techniques to create a modular program. And it demonstrates the ability to work with a partner inside a given framework of unfinished code to complete the code to given specifications by a deadline. 

Overall this is a really interesting project as it allows you to see what people are tweeting by both state and time and it visually maps the overall "sentiment" of those tweets to colorize a map.
